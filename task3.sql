-- Use the LIBRARY database
USE LIBRARY;

-- 1. SELECT all columns from Employees
SELECT * FROM Employees;

-- 2. SELECT specific columns: first_name, department, salary
SELECT first_name, department, salary FROM Employees;

-- 3. WHERE condition: Filter employees from HR department
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE department = 'HR';

-- 4. WHERE with AND: Employees from Finance earning more than 50000
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE department = 'Finance' AND salary > 50000;

-- 5. WHERE with OR: Employees in HR or IT departments
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE department = 'HR' OR department = 'IT';

-- 6. LIKE: Employees whose first name starts with 'J'
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE first_name LIKE 'J%';

-- 7. BETWEEN: Employees with salary between 45000 and 60000
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE salary BETWEEN 45000 AND 60000;

-- 8. ORDER BY salary ascending
SELECT * FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary ASC;

-- 9. ORDER BY join_date descending
SELECT * FROM Employees
ORDER BY join_date DESC;

-- 10. LIMIT: Show only top 3 records
SELECT * FROM Employees
LIMIT 3;

-- 11. Combine WHERE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT
-- Example: Top 2 highest-paid employees in Marketing or Sales
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE department IN ('Marketing', 'Sales')
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 2;

-- 12. Using aliasing for better readability
SELECT first_name AS 'First Name', department AS 'Dept', salary AS 'Monthly Salary'
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;
